# Embracing the Future of Decentralized Exchanges with DEX Aggregators

## Introduction to DEX Aggregators
Have you ever wondered if it's possible to simultaneously connect to all decentralized exchanges (DEXs), compare prices across them, and choose the one offering the best deal? Well, now it's not just a possibility â€“ it's a reality, thanks to DEX aggregators!

## Using a DEX Aggregator (DEXag)
DEX aggregators like @paraswap, @1inch, and @matchaxyz are changing the game by providing the best available prices across all DEXs on a chain. This innovation in the cryptocurrency world is not only convenient but also cost-effective.

A DEX aggregator typically goes a step further by splitting transactions across multiple DEXs and pools. This approach optimizes each pool's liquidity and results in more advantageous transactions than if they were executed on a single DEX or pool.

## Real-world Examples
For instance, to swap 10k ARB for DAI, Paraswap first swaps to USDC on @traderjoe_xyz, then to DAI on UniswapV3. However, for a larger amount like 100k ARB, it's more beneficial to split the trade across several routes to avoid unbalancing a single pool and experiencing slippage.

So, how does one choose the right DEX aggregator? Thanks to @DefiLlama, you don't have to worry anymore! DeFiLlama Swap is a meta-aggregator that connects to all DEX aggregators to offer you the best of the best prices.

For 10k ARB, the best price seems to be on @KyberNetwork, whereas for 100k ARB, Firebird offers a more favorable rate. In this scenario, DeFiLlama Swap outperforms Paraswap in terms of pricing.

If you're not yet familiar with @DefiLlama's new tool, I highly recommend using it for all your swaps. It's set to save you even more than standard DEX aggregators.
