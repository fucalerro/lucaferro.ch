# I craft user-centered digital product.

Like the world around us and the business I work with, my design workflow is constantly moving and improving. During the past 3 years, I have been focused on designing user interfaces and experiences for Web3 product and services.  

Every, morning, I wake up early because I want to:

**Create friendly products for the many**  
**Contribue to the ongoing DeFi inclusion**  
**Streamline complex processes into friendly interfaces**
