# UIUX designer, DeFi enthusiast and 42 Lausanne student

Hey there! Glad to have you here. I'm a UI/UX designer with a focus on DeFi and cryptocurrency applications, bringing over two years of experience in designing decentralized apps (dApps) for various crypto projects. My journey has led me to study at 42 Lausanne, driven by the belief that design truly shines when coupled with the skills to build it.

In the scarce free moments I find, I like to explore and write about the most innovative DeFi applications. This not only fuels my professional growth but also satisfies my personal curiosity in the ever-evolving crypto financial landscape.

To maintain a balance, I like to street workout, stretch and ski. These activities not only keep me in shape but also provide a necessary and refreshing counterbalance to my intellectual pursuits.

## Dive into my work

I worked 2 years for Truevel SA, a swiss company building open source crypto projects. Most of my work was focused on Swapbox, a serverless, exchangeless crypto ATM powered by decentralized exchanges and stablecoins.
